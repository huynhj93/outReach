//1. Create a function called createCounter.
//   Inside the function body, create a variable called privateCount and initialize it to 0;
//   Create a function called changeBy that takes in a value, and increments the privateCounter by 
//   that value;
//   Finally, return an object with properties called "increment", "decrement", and "value".
//   Increment should be a function that calls changeBy(1), decremenent should be a function
//   that call changeBy(-1), and value should be a function that returns privateCounter;

var createCounter = 'FILL ME IN';

//  Try console logging privateCounter variable out here. What do you get? How can we access
//  private counter? How can we change the value of privateCount? Can we change the value 
//  by 5 directly by calling changeBy?
